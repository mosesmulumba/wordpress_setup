# wordpress_setup
installation of wordpress using a simple yaml file

# using docker to install wordpress
I think this is the most simple way.

# All you have to do is add a docker-compose file
This file is set to install and configure the php, mysql , 
and wordpress services and networks and once.

# Run the file
docker-compose up 
or 
docker-compose up -d
so that the logs can load from the background

# Stop the servers
doscker-compose down
